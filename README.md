## ‚ú® Core Features

UniCurve is packed with powerful features designed for both students and administrators.

### üßë‚Äçüéì For Students:

*   **Optimal Timetable Generation:**
    *   Leverages a **custom priority-based scheduling algorithm** to automatically generate the top three best possible timetables based on subject prerequisites and real-time dependencies.
*   **Dynamic Subject Dependency Tree:**
    *   An interactive, visual graph that clearly shows which subjects unlock others, helping students plan multiple semesters ahead.
*   **Comprehensive GPA & Progress Tools:**
    *   **GPA Calculator:** Instantly calculate term and cumulative GPA.
    *   **GPA Improvement Plan:** Receive intelligent suggestions on what grades are needed to reach a target GPA.
    *   **Progress Visualizer:** Track completed credits, remaining subjects, and overall academic standing at a glance.
*   **Doctor & Subject Information:**
    *   Browse detailed information about each subject and see which professors are teaching it.

### üîë For Admins:

*   **Secure Admin Panel:** A separate, secure interface for university administrators to manage the core academic data.
*   **Full CRUD Functionality:** Admins can easily Create, Read, Update, and Delete subjects, timetables, and professor information, ensuring the app's data is always up-to-date.

## üß† The Core Algorithm

The heart of UniCurve is a custom, heuristic-based scheduling algorithm designed to solve the complex problem of timetable creation. It intelligently finds the best schedules by following these steps:

1.  **Priority Scoring:** It first calculates a "priority weight" for every available subject based on how many future courses it unlocks. This ensures that critical "gateway" subjects are prioritized.

2.  **Ranked List Generation:** All available subjects are sorted into a list from highest to lowest priority.

3.  **Iterative Timetable Construction:** The algorithm iterates through the prioritized list, attempting to add one subject at a time to a new timetable.

4.  **Intelligent Conflict Resolution (The Core Logic):** When adding a new subject (e.g., `Numerical Analysis`) results in a time conflict with an already-placed subject (e.g., `Math 2`):
    *   **It doesn't fail.** Instead, it first attempts to resolve the conflict by trying all other available sections or categories for `Math 2`.
    *   If no section of `Math 2` works, the algorithm **backtracks** further. It will then try to change the section of the *previous* subject (`Programming 2`) to free up a new time slot that could accommodate both `Math 2` and `Numerical Analysis`.
    *   This backtracking and permutation process allows the system to explore multiple combinations to find a valid, conflict-free schedule.

5.  **Presenting Top 3 Options:** The entire process is run to generate the **top three most optimal, conflict-free timetable options**, giving the student the power to choose the best schedule for their needs.
