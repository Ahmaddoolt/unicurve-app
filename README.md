## 🧠 The Core Algorithm: Intelligent Schedule Generation

The magic behind UniCurve is a custom, heuristic-based scheduling algorithm designed to navigate the complex constraints of university timetabling. It's not just a simple search; it's a strategic process.

Here's how it works:

1.  **Data Aggregation:** The algorithm first gathers all necessary data from the Supabase backend:
    *   The student's passed subjects (`student_taken_subjects`).
    *   All prerequisite relationships (`subject_relationships`).
    *   All currently open subjects and their available sections/groups (`subjects`, `subject_groups`).
    *   The student's major requirements and remaining credit hours.

2.  **Dynamic Priority Scoring:** It calculates a "priority score" for every available subject. This score is a combination of:
    *   **Static Priority:** A predefined importance set by the university admin (e.g., a critical capstone project).
    *   **Dynamic "Unlock" Score:** A calculated weight based on how many future courses this subject unlocks. This ensures critical "gateway" subjects are prioritized.

3.  **Recursive Backtracking Search:** The algorithm begins a recursive search to build valid schedules.
    *   It starts with an empty schedule and iterates through the prioritized list of subjects.
    *   For each subject, it tries to fit one of its available sections (lecture, lab, etc.) into the schedule.
    *   **Conflict Detection:** It instantly checks for time conflicts with any courses already in the schedule.

4.  **Intelligent Conflict Resolution & Pruning:** If a conflict occurs, the algorithm doesn't just give up. It intelligently backtracks, trying different sections of previously placed courses to free up slots. This process explores thousands of potential combinations efficiently. To avoid infinite loops and maintain performance, the search is pruned after finding a sufficient number of high-quality solutions (`~300`).

5.  **Ranking and Optimization:** Once a pool of valid schedules is generated, they are ranked based on user preference:
    *   **Default:** Maximize total priority score and credit hours.
    *   **Minimize Days:** Find the schedule with the highest value that fits into the fewest number of days per week.

6.  **Generating Top 3 Alternatives:** To provide genuine choice, the algorithm generates the 2nd and 3rd best options by systematically excluding the least important courses from the #1 optimal schedule and re-running the search. This provides meaningful alternatives, not just minor variations.

This sophisticated approach ensures that the student is always presented with schedules that are not only conflict-free but strategically optimized for their academic progress.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack & Architecture

*   **Frontend:** **Flutter** - For a high-performance, cross-platform mobile experience.
*   **Backend & Database:** **Supabase** - Leveraged for its powerful PostgreSQL database, authentication, and instant APIs to support a multi-tenant architecture.
*   **State Management:** **Riverpod** - To provide a robust, scalable, and reactive state management architecture.
*   **Architecture:** Clean **MVC-like structure** with a clear separation between data (Repository), logic (Providers/Controllers), and UI (Views). This makes the app highly maintainable and scalable for different universities.
*   **Localization:** **GetX** - For easy and efficient internationalization (i18n) support.

<summary><strong>🗄️ Supabase Database Schema Overview</strong></summary>

The backend is supported by a relational database schema designed for scalability and data integrity. **Foreign keys linking to `university_id` and `major_id` ensure that all data—from subjects to admin privileges—is properly segregated for each institution.**
