🧠 The Core Algorithm: Intelligent Schedule Generation
The magic behind UniCurve is a custom, heuristic-based scheduling algorithm designed to navigate the complex constraints of university timetabling. It's not just a simple search; it's a strategic process.
Here's how it works:
Data Aggregation: The algorithm first gathers all necessary data from the Supabase backend:
The student's passed subjects (student_taken_subjects).
All prerequisite relationships (subject_relationships).
All currently open subjects and their available sections/groups (subjects, subject_groups).
The student's major requirements and remaining credit hours.
Dynamic Priority Scoring: It calculates a "priority score" for every available subject. This score is a combination of two factors:
Static Priority: A predefined importance set by the university admin (e.g., a critical capstone project).
Dynamic "Unlock" Score: This is the core of the strategic prioritization. The algorithm analyzes the subject_relationships table to determine how many future courses are unlocked by completing a specific subject. For example, if "Programming 2" is a prerequisite for 5 advanced courses, it receives a dynamic priority of +5. This ensures that critical "gateway" courses, which open up the most future options, are naturally pushed to the top of the recommendation list.
Recursive Backtracking Search: The algorithm begins a recursive search to build valid schedules.
It starts with an empty schedule and iterates through the prioritized list of subjects.
For each subject, it tries to fit one of its available sections (lecture, lab, etc.) into the schedule.
Conflict Detection: It instantly checks for time conflicts with any courses already in the schedule.
Intelligent Conflict Resolution & Pruning: If a conflict occurs, the algorithm doesn't just give up. It intelligently backtracks, trying different sections of previously placed courses to free up slots. This process explores thousands of potential combinations efficiently. To avoid infinite loops and maintain performance, the search is pruned after finding a sufficient number of high-quality solutions (~300).
Ranking and Optimization: Once a pool of valid schedules is generated, they are ranked based on user preference:
Default: Maximize total priority score and credit hours.
Minimize Days: Find the schedule with the highest value that fits into the fewest number of days per week.
Generating Top 3 Alternatives: To provide genuine choice, the algorithm generates the 2nd and 3rd best options by systematically excluding the least important courses from the #1 optimal schedule and re-running the search. This provides meaningful alternatives, not just minor variations.
This sophisticated approach ensures that the student is always presented with schedules that are not only conflict-free but strategically optimized for their academic progress.
🛠️ Technology Stack & Architecture
Frontend: Flutter - For a high-performance, cross-platform mobile experience from a single codebase.
Backend & Database: Supabase - Leveraged for its powerful PostgreSQL database, authentication, and instant APIs. Its row-level security is critical for the multi-tenant architecture.
Architecture: Pragmatic MVC - A clean, Model-View-Controller-like structure is used to ensure a clear separation of concerns, making the app highly maintainable and scalable.
Model: Data structures and repositories (lib/domain).
View: UI widgets and pages (lib/pages).
Controller: Business logic managed by Riverpod providers (lib/pages/.../providers).
State Management: Riverpod - Chosen for its compile-safe, declarative, and scalable approach. It enables a reactive UI and effectively decouples business logic from the widget tree, preventing common state issues.
Localization & Routing: GetX - Utilized specifically for its lightweight and efficient modules for:
Internationalization (i18n): Simple key.tr syntax for supporting English and Arabic.
Routing: Quick and easy navigation (Get.to, Get.back).

<summary><strong>🗄️ Supabase Database Schema Overview</strong></summary>
The backend is supported by a relational database schema designed for scalability and data integrity.
Multi-Tenancy at its Core: Most tables include a university_id, ensuring that data (subjects, majors, professors) for one university is completely isolated from another. This is the foundation of the platform's scalability.
Relational Integrity: Foreign key constraints are used extensively to maintain data consistency. For example, a subject_schedule cannot exist without a valid subject_group, which in turn cannot exist without a subject.
User Roles and Permissions: Supabase's built-in authentication and Row-Level Security (RLS) policies are used to define distinct roles (e.g., student, university_admin) and grant access only to the data they are authorized to see or modify.
